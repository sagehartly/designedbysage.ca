        <p class="kilo">This poster was designed as a contest for our final project of first year.
        We had members of the RCMP marketing team come and talk to us about a poster they needed to advertise a campaign where they would donate a percent of the sales from their shops to programs that helped local children. My design was selected as the winning poster and it has since been displayed in RCMP detachment barracks all over the country.</p>
        <p class="kilo">I used bright colours to quickly attract the attention of the viewer and used bold, clear imagery related to children to quickly convey the message of the campaign. I created the lettering myself to match the handmade, cut out feel for the piece.</p>
