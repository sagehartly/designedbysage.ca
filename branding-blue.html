      <p class="kilo">I recently had the pleasure of working with a new alternative school in Ottawa and developing their brand identity with their passionate staff.</p>
      <p class="kilo">My goal was to create a logo that showcased the importance of communication in this new type of school, as well as used the imagery of the blue sky to relate to the apt name!</p>
