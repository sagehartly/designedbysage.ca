      <p class="kilo">This was an assignment to find a poorly designed book cover and come up with a design solution that better captured the essence of the book.
        The book I chose was a book of knitting patterns. To reflect the content, I actually created a pattern myself and knitted out the title.</p>
      <p class="kilo">The only digital elements are the subtitle and author's name. All knitting, layout and design were created by myself and captured in a photograph.</p>
