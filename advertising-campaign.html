        <p class="kilo">This is a sample advertising campaign for Subway catering. The goal was to develop a campaign that would work across different platforms and apply to several of the target audiences that could be interested in Subway catering.</p>
        <p class="kilo">I wanted to use humour and illustration to highlight the many different groups that could benefit from Subway’s catering options.  The three different iterations of this campaign are meant to be shown across a print ad, a Facebook campaign and an outdoor bus ad.</p>
