        <p class="kilo">This is a movie poster I designed for the film Drive. I wanted to incorporate an interesting type treatment for the title that mimics the neon lights that are prevalent throughout the movie. I love the way the film has a vintage, yet modern feel so I tried to carry that through the poster as well.</p>
