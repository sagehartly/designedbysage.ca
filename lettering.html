      <p class="kilo">I love to explore handlettering and am constantly practicing to improve this skill. When I'm relaxing at home, I'm often sketching in my notebook the lyrics to whatever music I'm listening to or a quote from my favourite movie.</p>
      <p class="kilo">I created the branding for a fictional beer company to showcase some of the possibilties of handlettered design.</p>

      <p>I love craft beers, so I wanted to try designing an eye-catching beer label. I handlettered the logo as well as the type of beer for each the label. I used colour to define the visually define the different beers' identities. I also brought the logo throguh to a set of business cards.</p>

      <p>These are a few examples of cakes I have lettered for the bakery I work at, Little Jo Berry's. I also handlettered the back of a door at the bakery with the tagline that the owner uses in her social media posts, "Break Up With Your Boyfriend."</p>
