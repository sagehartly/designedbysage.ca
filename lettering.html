      <p class="kilo">I really love handlettering and I love to incorporate handmade elements into my work. This is a skill I am working to improve every day.</p>
      <p class="kilo">I created the branding for a fictional beer company to showcase some of the possibilities of handlettered design. I love the freedom and creativity that food and drink packaging allow, especially the current craft beer market. More often than not, I pick a beer based solely on their branding and packaging design. It's just so much easier to judge a beer by it's cover!</p>

      <p>I love craft beers, so I wanted to try designing an eye-catching beer label. I handlettered the logo as well as the type of beer for each the label. I used colour to visually define the different beers' identities.
        I also brought the logo through to a set of business cards.</p>

      <p>These are a few examples of cakes I have lettered for the bakery I work at, <a class="link" href="http://littlejoberrys.com"> Little Jo Berry's</a>. I also handlettered the back of a door at the bakery with the tagline that the owner uses in her social media posts, "Break Up With Your Boyfriend."</p>

      <p>I handlettered the cover of local musician, <a class="link" href="http://www.dangerously.ca/#_">Jesse Dangerously's</a> album cover for his cassette release. He also used this piece for the cover of a lyrics zine he distributed to his fans. I also created the headers for each of the songs within the zine.</p>
