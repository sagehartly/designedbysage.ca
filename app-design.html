        <p class="kilo">If you ride your bike in the city, you are familiar with the unease you feel when locking your bike on the street. Anything can happen and one thief can take away one of your most valuable possessions in just minutes.
          The You-Lock technology incorporates a state of the art smart u-lock that uses GPS installed into the frame of the bike. This allows the user to check on the status of any of the bikes in their network. The app also notifies you if any of the locks are being tampered with.</p>
        <p class="kilo">After reviewing the personas and researching of similar smart products on the market already,
          here is the app statement: "YOU-LOCK is a bike lock that enables bikers to have a security system while storing their bike."
          The next step was to build wireframes of the app flow of common tasks.</p>
        <p class="kilo">The logo incorporates a simplified image of a lock surrounded by a bike gear. I wanted the icon to be bold, and recognizable both as a lock app, and as related to bikes.
          The typography for the logo needed to be clean, clear and modern so I chose Museo Sans Rounded. The roundness of the font reflects the roundness of the logo.
          The main blues I chose for the app’s design are cool, calming and trustworthy. The contrasting orange is used to draw the viewer's eye to highlight key features.</p>
